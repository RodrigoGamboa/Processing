Processing sketches, in which I have worked in the last years; images, videos, prototypes, experiments, tools, works, concepts... 
Everything is unfinished, some may not work, When I had no ideas, I would open one to see what it was...

About images: 

You can use the images that are [here](https://www.behance.net/manoloide) for any purpose, if you want to modify or export them higher resolution you will have to render them with the code.


Most of the images are in /20**/generative/ you just have to run it and search for a seed you like by pressing any button, if you like one press "S". Many images have filters, I used Analog Efex for a long time, now I see it is paid, before it was free... I don't know if the preset still works in the new version... (if you search you find) but the presets is in the "Analog Efex back" folder. 

Sometimes I remove the vowels and replace it with the previous consonant, not being so literal...
